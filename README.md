# DBMS-Mini-Project-Library-Management-System
This Project deals with Library Mangement System.Library management refers to the systematic
and efficient administration of library resources, services, and operations to meet the needs of
library users. The primary goal of library management is to ensure that library collections are wellorganized,
accessible, and able to support the educational, informational, and recreational needs of
the community it serves. This involves a range of activities and processes aimed at maintaining and
improving the overall functionality of a library.
The issue with the Current Library Management System is that manual procedures make member
administration, circulation control, and book cataloguing ineffective. This leads to mistakes, lags,
and difficulties keeping correct data and giving customers the best possible service.
Thus by visiting our website the user can u able to borrow books for a certain amount of time .However
we have added the condition where based on membership level of the user ,he can borrow limited
amount of books ,like membership level 1 users can borrow at most 3 books and higher level of
membership enables them to borrow some more books and so on.The admin(Library Member) has the
priveledge of adding new books to the collection,which can of of different genre,publishers,Authors
etc.They even have the privelege of updating ,and deleting books.Thus library Management system
serves as a comprehensive solution,enhancing user satisfaction etc.
